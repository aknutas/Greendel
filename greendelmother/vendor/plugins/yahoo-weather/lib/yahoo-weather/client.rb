  # The lookup requires the unique WOEID for the location whose
  # weather is sought.. To find your WOEID, browse or search for your
  # city from the Weather (http://weather.yahoo.com/) home page. The
  # WOEID is in the URL for the forecast page for that city. You can
  # also get the WOEID by entering your zip code on the home page. For
  # example, if you search for Los Angeles on the Weather home page,
  # the forecast page for that city is
  # http://weather.yahoo.com/united-states/california/los-angeles-2442047/. The
  # WOEID is 2442047.
  #
  # +units+ allows specifying whether to retrieve information in
  # +Fahrenheit+ as YahooWeather::Units::FAHRENHEIT, or +Celsius+ as
  # YahooWeather::Units::CELSIUS, and defaults to fahrenheit.

  # Returns a YahooWeather::Response object detailing the current weather
  # information for the specified location.
  #
  # NOTE: This method is deprecated as Yahoo has deprecated this
  # non-WOEID-based lookup function.  Please use the new
  # +lookup_by_woeid+ method instead.
  #
  # +location+ can be either a US zip code or a location code.  Location
  # codes can be looked up at http://weather.yahoo.com, where it will appear
  # in the URL that results from searching on the city or zip code.  For
  # instance, searching on 'Seattle, WA' results in a URL ending in
  # 'USWA0395.html', so the location code for Seattle is 'USWA0395'.
  #
  # +units+ allows specifying whether to retrieve information in
  # +Fahrenheit+ as YahooWeather::Units::FAHRENHEIT, or +Celsius+ as
  # YahooWeather::Units::CELSIUS, and defaults to fahrenheit.
